      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <div class="introduction">
        <p>I was inspired to enroll in a coding bootcamp after working cross-functionally with development teams in my
          previous
          positions. Seeing the development teams work to build the companyâ€™s platforms and products, and solve problems
          encountered by customers and colleagues inspired me to pursue this as a career.</p>
        <p>
          I am looking to join a workplace where I could bring my skills of abductive reasoning, risk-based decision
          making as
          well as my familiarity with UK Financial regulations. I would like to further develop myself and my skills to
          become a
          valued member of the team.

            <p>Javascript, HTML, CSS</p>
            <p>The project was to make a web application game based on the classic arcade
              game Frogger, and I gave mine a cat twist. I used CSS and HTML in order to style
              the page. The entire game was written in JavaScript, using object-oriented code.</p>

            <p>This was a hackathon project to be built with a partner in 48 hours. We made
              ours to deliver the perfect lockdown evening plan. The project brief was to write
              the project using React.js. It contains multiple third-party APIs (such as the
              cocktail database, and OMDB API, etc.) calls. These calls are made using the data the user populates.</p>

            <p>The project is a full-stack web application that was completed in 8 days within a group of 3. The project
              is inspired by
              event
              sites, but given a twist that all ticket holders can participate in polls and comments on the event
              page.The database
              was
              PostreSQL, modelled using Django.The front end was mostly written in React.js Hooks using Express.js..</p>
