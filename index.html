      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I was inspired to enroll in a coding bootcamp after working cross-functionally with development teams in my
        previous
        positions. Seeing the development teams work to build the companyâ€™s platforms and products, and solve problems
        encountered by customers and colleagues inspired me to pursue this as a career.
        I am looking to join a workplace where I could bring my skills of abductive reasoning, risk-based decision
        making as
        well as my familiarity with UK Financial regulations. I would like to further develop myself and my skills to
        become a
        valued member of the team.
